**Stone Pass** is a minimalist, skill-based mobile game where precision, timing, and strategy matter.  
Instead of throwing stones, players *tap and strike* stones to guide them through narrow gates and challenging paths.

Designed with a clean visual style and smooth physics, **Stone Pass** delivers a satisfying arcade experience inspired by classic precision games.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- You control **three stones** on the field.
- Tap near a stone to **strike it**, not throw it.
- Your goal is to pass the moving stone **between the other two stones**.
- After a successful pass, guide the stone through the **gate at the top**.
- Each level increases difficulty with tighter gates, friction changes, and obstacles.

One wrong move — and it’s game over.

## 🧠 Game Rules

- Stones must pass **cleanly between the other two stones** before reaching the gate.
- Hitting another stone, an obstacle, or leaving the screen results in **failure**.
- Stones slow down due to **friction** — plan your strike carefully.
- Some levels include **moving or dangerous obstacles**.
- Precision matters more than speed.
